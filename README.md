# TFLite-Object-Detection

Object Detection Model: This repository contains an object detection model that has been optimized using quantization techniques and converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format. It is seamlessly integrated with Android Studio, making it easy to deploy on Android devices for real-time object detection.

Quantization is a process used in machine learning and deep learning to reduce the precision of numeric values while preserving the essential information required for a specific task. It involves converting high-precision floating-point numbers into lower-precision fixed-point numbers or integers.By reducing the precision of numeric values, it allows deep learning models to be deployed on a wider range of devices and platforms while still achieving acceptable levels of accuracy.

*The repository itself does not contain the codes for quantization techniques and conversion to TFLite. Only the TFLite model itself is uploaded here.*
*The new APK version has some additional features that were not present in the old code.*

Weight and Activation Quantization
Dynamic Range Quantization
Fixed-Point Quantization and Integer-Only Quantization
Channel-Wise Quantization are some of the techniques
